1) a) Write a shell program to find Fibonacci series.

$ vim fibonacciseries.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the number of terms:"
read n
a=0
b=1
echo "The Fibonacci series is:"
for (( i=0; i<n; i++ ))
do
    echo -n "$a "
    fn=$((a + b))
    a=$b
    b=$fn
done
echo

Output --> $ vim fibonacciseries.sh
           $sh fibonacciseries.sh
           This is program for fibonacci series
           Enter the number of terms:
           10
           The Fibonacci series is:
           0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
           

2) b) Write a shell program to find largest of three numbers.


$ vim largestamongthreenumbers.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter three numbers:"
read a b c
if [ $a -gt $b ] && [ $a -gt $c ]; then
    echo "$a is the largest number."
elif [ $b -gt $a ] && [ $b -gt $c ]; then
    echo "$b is the largest number."
else
    echo "$c is the largest number."
fi

Output --> $ vim largestamongthreenumbers.sh
           Lakshay@Lenovo-M ~
           $sh largestamong threenumbers.sh
           This is a program to find largest among three numbers.
           Enter three numbers:
           7 18 45
           45 is the largest number.

           
           $ vim largestamong threenumbers.sh
           $sh largestamong threenumbers.sh
           This is a program to find largest among three numbers.
           Enter three numbers:
           45 15 77
           77 is the largest number.

3) c) Write a shell program to find average of N numbers

$ vim averageofNnumbers.sh

echo This is program to find average of N numbers
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the number of elements:"
read n
sum=0
echo "Enter the numbers of terms for which yoy want the average:"
for (( i=0; i<n; i++ ))
do
    read num
    sum=$((sum + num))
done
average=$(echo "scale=2; $sum / $n" | bc)
echo "The average of the given number is $average"

Output --> $ vim averageofNnumbers.sh
           $ sh averageofNnumbers.sh
           This is program to find average of N numbers
           Enter the number for which you want the average:
           5
           Enter the numbers:
           5
           10
           15
           20
           25
           The average of the given numbers is 15.00

           
           $ vim averageofNnumbers.sh
           $sh averageofNnumbers.sh
           This is program to find average of N numbers
           Enter the number of terms for which you want the average:
           5
           Enter the numbers:
           5
           10
           15
           20
           25
           The average of the given numbers is 15.0
