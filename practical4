1)  a) Write a shell program to check whether a number is even or odd

$ vim oddeven.sh

echo
echo This is program to check whether a number is even or odd
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "$num is even."
else
  echo "$num is odd."
fi

Output --> $ vim oddeven.sh
           $ sh oddeven.sh
           This is program to find whether a number is even or odd Enter a number:
           544
           544 is even.
            
           $ sh oddeven.sh
           This is program to find whether a number is even or odd Enter a number:
           9999
           9999 is odd.





2)  b) Write a shell program to find whether a number is prime or not.

$ vim primeornot.sh

echo
echo echo This is program to find whether a number is prime or not
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
is_prime=1
for ((i=2; i<=num/2; i++))
do
  if [ $((num % i)) -eq 0 ]
  then
    is_prime=0
    break
  fi
done

if [ $is_prime -eq 1 ]
then
  echo "$num is a prime number."
else
  echo "$num is not a prime number."
fi

Output --> $ vim primeornot.sh
           $ sh primeornot.sh
           This is a program to find whether a number is prime or not. Enter a number:
           17
           17 is a prime number.
            
            
           $ sh primeornot.sh
           This is a program to find whether a number is prime or not.
           Enter a number:
           45
           45 is not a prime number.




3)  c) Write a shell program to find whether a number is palindrome or not.


echo 
echo This is program to find whether a number is palindrome or not
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
reverse=0
original_num=$num

while [ $num -gt 0 ]
do
  remainder=$((num % 10))
  reverse=$((reverse * 10 + remainder))
  num=$((num / 10))
done

if [ $original_num -eq $reverse ]
then
  echo "$original_num is a palindrome."
else
  echo "$original_num is not a palindrome."
fi

Output --> $sh palindromeornot.sh
           This is a program to find whether a number is palindrome or not.
           Enter a number:
           45354
           45354 is a palindrome.
            
            
           $sh palindromeornot.sh
           This is a program to find whether a number is palindrome or not.
           Enter a number:
           453
           453 is not a palindrome.




4)  d) Write a shell program to type number 1 to 7 and then print its corresponding day of week

$ vim weekday.sh

echo
echo This is program to type number 1 to 7 and then print its corresponding day of week
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number (1-7):"
read num

case $num in
  1) echo "Monday" ;;
  2) echo "Tuesday" ;;
  3) echo "Wednesday" ;;
  4) echo "Thursday" ;;
  5) echo "Friday" ;;
  6) echo "Saturday" ;;
  7) echo "Sunday" ;;
  *) echo "Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 7." ;;
esac

Output --> $ vim weekday.sh
           $ sh weekday.sh
           This is a program to type number 1 to 7 and then print its corresponding day of week
           Enter a number from 1 to 7:
           1
           Monday
            
            
           $ sh weekday.sh
           This is a program to type number 1 to 7 and then print its corresponding day of week
           Enter a number from 1 to 7:
           7 Sunday
            
            
           $ sh weekday.sh
           This is a program to type number 1 to 7 and then print its corresponding day of week
           Enter a number from 1 to 7:
           8
           Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.
